# ðŸŽ“ LEARNING NOTES - CARGO CONCEPTS:
# 
# 1. PACKAGE METADATA:
#    - name: The name of your crate/package
#    - version: Semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)
#    - edition: Rust edition (2021 is latest, required for Bevy)
#
# 2. DEPENDENCIES:
#    - bevy = "0.16.0" uses exact version
#    - Could also use "0.16" for latest patch version
#    - Features can be enabled with features = ["feature_name"]
#
# 3. PROFILES:
#    - [profile.release]: Settings for `cargo build --release`
#    - [profile.dev]: Settings for `cargo build` (development)
#    - opt-level: Optimization level (0=none, 1=basic, 2=good, 3=aggressive)
#    - lto: Link Time Optimization (slower compile, faster runtime)
#    - codegen-units: Parallel code generation (1=slower compile, better optimization)
#
# 4. DEVELOPMENT OPTIMIZATIONS:
#    - [profile.dev.package."*"]: Optimize dependencies even in dev mode
#    - This makes Bevy run faster while keeping your code compilation fast
#
# COMMANDS TO REMEMBER:
# - `cargo run`: Compile and run (development mode)
# - `cargo run --release`: Compile and run (optimized)
# - `cargo build`: Just compile
# - `cargo check`: Fast syntax/type checking without full compilation
